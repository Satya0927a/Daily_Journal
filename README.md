This is my first fullstack website completely made my me, i followed zero tutorials it was all me and some help from chatgpt i learned a lot from this project, the frontend part is not fully complete yet, the login doesnt check for passwords yet make sure the username is complicated enough haha, will continue to work on it in future 

The website is live on ==> https://dailyjournal-ucml.onrender.com/ (right now looks better on mobile)

My workflow during this project:
Genrating a simple ui from chat gpt ===> thinking of all the data i will need to store ===> creating a backend with demo data ===> connecting the backend with database ===> continued to work on the backend part creating all the api i will need ===> creating a simple fronted ===> connecting the frontend with backend 

Features incoming:
1. A proper user authentication with username and password
2. Updated frontend that is responsive for both mobile and pc 

Thank you for checking out my project
